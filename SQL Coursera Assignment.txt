Part 1: Yelp Dataset Profiling and Understanding

1. Profile the data by finding the total number of records for each of the tables below:
	
i. Attribute table = 10000
ii. Business table = 10000
iii. Category table = 10000
iv. Checkin table = 10000
v. elite_years table = 10000
vi. friend table = 10000
vii. hours table = 10000
viii. photo table = 10000
ix. review table = 10000 
x. tip table = 10000 
xi. user table = 10000 
	


2. Find the total distinct records by either the foreign key or primary key for each table. If two foreign keys are listed in the table, please specify which foreign key.

i. Business = 10000
ii. Hours = 1562
iii. Category = 2643
iv. Attribute = 1115  
v. Review = 10000 
vi. Checkin = 493 
vii. Photo = 10000
viii. Tip = 3979 (business_id)
ix. User = 10000
x. Friend = 11
xi. Elite_years = 2780

Note: Primary Keys are denoted in the ER-Diagram with a yellow key icon.	



3. Are there any columns with null values in the Users table? Indicate "yes," or "no."

	Answer: No
	
	SQL code used to arrive at answer:
	Select *
	from user
	where Coalesce (id, name, review_count, yelping_since, useful, funny, cool, fans, average_stars, compliment_hot, compliment_more, compliment_profile, compliment_cute,
	compliment_list, compliment_note, compliment_plain, compliment_cool, compliment_funny, compliment_writer, compliment_photos) is null
	

	
4. For each table and column listed below, display the smallest (minimum), largest (maximum), and average (mean) value for the following fields:

	i. Table: Review, Column: Stars
	
		min:1		max:5		avg:3.7082
		
	
	ii. Table: Business, Column: Stars
	
		min:1.0		max:5.0		avg:3.6549 
		
	
	iii. Table: Tip, Column: Likes
	
		min:0		max:2		avg:0.0144
		
	
	iv. Table: Checkin, Column: Count
	
		min:1		max:53 		avg:1.9414 
		
	
	v. Table: User, Column: Review_count
	
		min:0		max:2000 		avg:24.2995 
		


5. List the cities with the most reviews in descending order:

	Select city,Sum(review_count) as Reviews 
	From business 
	Group by city 
	Order by Reviews DESC
	
	Copy and Paste the Result Below:

+------------------------+--------+--------------+


8. Does posing more reviews correlate with more fans?

	Please explain your findings and interpretation of the results:
	
The number of review counts by users does not correlate to them having more fans. As the top 20 users with the most number
of review_count do not have a linear representive of fans. Example would be the num 9th user with the most number of review_count (497)
has 9x more fans compared to the 2nd user with the most number of review counts (50).

Part 2: Inferences and Analysis

1. Pick one city and category of your choice and group the businesses in that city or category by their overall star rating. Compare the businesses with 2-3 stars to the businesses with 4-5 stars and answer the following questions. Include your code.
	
i. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different distribution of hours?
Yes, they have different opening hours and a business in the 4-5 stars rating group have a optimum opening hours from afternoon to night. Whereas a business in the 2-3 stars category open from early morning to late evening for their service. 
One business from each rating group do not have their hours stated on Yelp. 

select business.id,
name, 
city,
stars,
category,
hours,
review_count
From business Inner join category on business.id = category.business_id 
inner join hours on business.id = hours.business_id
where city = 'Phoenix' and category = 'Food'
order by hours ASC;

ii. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different number of reviews?
        
	Yes, they have different review counts and generally business with 4-5 stars have alot more reviews than those businesses with 2-3 stars. Except for one business with a 5 stars review.  
     Therefore, for businesses to have higher star rating, the businesses are encouraged to get their customers to leave a review on their business.

select business.id,

city,

From business Inner join category on business.id = category.business_id

iii. Are you able to infer anything from the location data provided between these two groups? Explain.

Unable to infer much from their location data as there are no description on their neighbourhoods and based on their postal code and coordinates,
they are nearby within the city. 

SQL code used for analysis:

select business.id,

From business Inner join category on business.id = category.business_id

2. Group business based on the ones that are open and the ones that are closed. What differences can you find between the ones that are still open and the ones that are closed? List at least two differences and the SQL code you used to arrive at your answer.
		
i. Difference 1:
      There are cities that do not have businesses that are closed. Hence businesses can explore entering or expanding into these cities. The likelihood of them surviving from those cities economy contribution is higher. 
Cities like Ajax, Ahwatukee and Bay Village etc. 

select distinct city,
is_open
From business 
where is_open = '1'
order by city ASC
         
ii. Difference 2:
        Certain category of business are more likely to survive in today's business climate. 
         Examples of category of business that has 0 closure are, Activelife, Yoga and Travel Services etc
         
SQL code used for analysis:

select business.id,
category,
is_open
From business Inner join category on business.id = category.business_id 
where is_open = '1'
order by category ASC

select business.id,
category,
is_open
From business Inner join category on business.id = category.business_id 
where is_open = '1'
order by category DESC
	
3. For this last part of your analysis, you are going to choose the type of analysis you want to conduct on the Yelp dataset and are going to prepare the data for analysis.

Ideas for analysis include: Parsing out keywords and business attributes for sentiment analysis, clustering businesses to find commonalities or anomalies between them, predicting the overall star rating for a business, predicting the number of fans a user will have, and so on. These are just a few examples to get you started, so feel free to be creative and come up with your own problem you want to solve. Provide answers, in-line, to all of the following:
	
i. Indicate the type of analysis you chose to do:
    
	The type of business categories that have survived longer than other business category based on whether do they have a 5 star ratings and high review count. 
         
ii. Write 1-2 brief paragraphs on the type of data you will need for your analysis and why you chose that data:
     
        I will need to find out the list of category of businesses that are open and have 5 star ratings with more than 50 review counts. From there, I will cross check whether did any businesses that belongs to those categories close down before the present. 
		
iii. Output of your finished dataset:
         
		 The top catgories businesses should open in the current business climate are Arabian, Auto Repair, Automotive, Halal, Mediterranean, Oil Change Stations and Transmission Repair.
         
iv. Provide the SQL code you used to create your final dataset:

select distinct category,
is_open,
stars,
review_count
From business Inner join category on business.id = category.business_id 
Where is_open ='1' and stars >= 5 and review_count >= 50
order by category ASC

+---------------------+---------+-------+--------------+
| category            | is_open | stars | review_count |
+---------------------+---------+-------+--------------+
| Arabian             |       1 |   5.0 |          267 |
